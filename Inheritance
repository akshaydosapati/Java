/*Inheritance is like copying the properties and values of one class to other class
 *IN the below example, Shapes is the parent class and square, rectangle are child classes of parent
 *By default, whatever the things parent consists will be inherited to it's child, 
 *along with that we can also add extra propertities or anything we require to child classes

*****Hierarchical Inheritance****** ---> single parent consists multiple children
*****Hybrid Inheritance***** ---> it is a combination of all inheritances 


   *******************Multiple Inheritance*******************
      definition: a child class can be derived from mutliple classes
      Generally java doesn't support multiple inheritance because:

            class A{
                show();
            }
            class B{
                show();
            }
            class C extends A,B{

            } 
    /*a class can be derived from single class
     *If we try to dervive from two parents, it leads to ambiguity
     *while calling the show method with C refernce, the JVM will confuse which show method to be used.
