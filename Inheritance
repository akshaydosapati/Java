/*Inheritance is like copying the properties and values of one class to other class
 *IN the below example, Shapes is the parent class and square, rectangle are child classes of parent
 *By default, whatever the things parent consists will be inherited to it's child, 
 *along with that we can also add extra propertities or anything we require to child classes
